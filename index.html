                Hello, my name is Shakeel Khan I am 25 years old, and coming from Stockton, California. So far in my life, I have been going through a lot of drawbacks I have experience in graphic design both as an intern and student at Sacramento State University. I had an opportunity to do a final portfolio with the help of my professor at Sac State, but I did not get accepted so I had to make one of two possible decisions either change a major or transfer to another university, I decided to go through this coding boot camp as a last resort because I do not want to deal another four years at a university. That is why I am here thank you all for reading and it is very nice to meet you!
