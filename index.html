            <p>
                Hello my name is Shakeel Khan I am 25 years coming from Stockton California. So far in my life I have been going through a lot of draw backs I have experince in graphic design in both as an intern and student at Sacramento State University. I had an opportunity to do a final portfolio with the help of my professor at Sac State, but some how I did not get accepted which I had to make two decisions either change a major or tranfer to another university, but I decided to go through this coding bootcamp as a last resort because I do not want to deal another four years at a university. That is why I am here thank you all for reading and it is very nice to meet you!

               <p>
                This is one of the projects I have done where I used Lightroom, Photoshop, and a bit of Illustration just for experimentation.
